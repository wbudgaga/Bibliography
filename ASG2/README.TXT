Structure:
	The main folder, ASG2,  contains :

	- BibliographyProj.tar: The whole project that was implemented  using netbeans.

	- srcCode.tar: source code of the implemented java bean. It is the src folder of the project.

	- Bibliography.jar:  deployable Java Bean.

	- testBibFile.bib: text file,used by testScript.sh,  contains names of hosts that is used to run chat clients on.
	
	- README.TXT: readme file.

Execution:
You can test the Bibliography bean using BeanBox. All you need to do to add the Bean to BeanBox is to copy the deployable bean(Bibliography.jar) in the  BeanBox's subdirectory named jars. This directory contains the JAR files for the Beans that are used by BeanBox. You can also load the bean at run-time by using the File menu and selecting LoadJar.

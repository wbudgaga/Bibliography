# Bibliography
In this project,  I used Bean Development Kit and an existing TickTock bean to implement Bibliography bean.

The Bibliography bean receives references that are given in the form of a LaTeX bibfile. Each entry in bibfile is of the form:
@article{malaiya1,  
         author = {Y. K. Malaiya and A. Mayrhauser and P. K. Srimani},  
         title = {``{An} {Examination} of {Fault} {Exposure} {Ratio}''},  
         journal = {IEEE Trans. on Software Engineering},  
         volume = 19,
         number = 11,
         pages = {1087--1094},
         month = {November},
         year = 1993}
and generates entries in increasing order based on any one of the following criteria:
